<h3 id="description" align="center">I am a Fullstack Engineer with a love for flexible software</h3>

## Current Job
I am currently working at [Skyqraft](https://skyqraft.com) in Stockholm ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. I have been with Skyqraft since (almost) it's inception.

My current role at Skyqraft is that of Fullstack Developer, but I do much more than that. I work in almost all fields (DevOps, InfoSec, Fullstack, Account manager e.t.c). That's life at a startup - which is why I love my job.

If you want to work with me - have a look at our current open positions at [our website](https://www.skyqraft.com/career).

## Previous Projects
I have a few cool projects from the past. I only want to showcase SquadCAM since it's easily the coolest one of them all. I will add more here as time progress.

### [SquadCAM](https://github.com/andreehultgren/Squad-CAM)
Squadcam was a project from my studies at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) where we aimed to build a computer vision explanation method that would outperform the current state of the art method [Grad-CAM](https://towardsdatascience.com/understand-your-algorithm-with-grad-cam-d3b62fce353).

We analysed the mathematics of Grad-CAM, tested a few ideas and found one manipulation of their method that localised the explanation better than Grad-CAM. This was used by squaring a back-propagation weight, which gave us the name Squad-CAM (Squared Grad-CAM).

To ensure our method was more explanatory than Grad-CAM, we deployed a survey and sent it around and recieved 5000 replies which confirmed that our explanation method was more intuative than that of Grad-CAM. You can read more details about our results [here](https://github.com/andreehultgren/Squad-CAM/blob/main/Squad-CAM.pdf).
